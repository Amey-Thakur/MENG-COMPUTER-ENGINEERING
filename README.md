## Overview

This repository serves as a centralized index to all academic work completed during the Master of Engineering program in Computer Engineering at the [University of Windsor](https://www.uwindsor.ca). Each linked repository contains lecture notes, laboratory assignments, project implementations, reference materials, and supplementary resources for the respective course.

**Purpose**: To provide organized access to educational content spanning four semesters of graduate study, facilitating knowledge sharing and academic reference.

**Target Audience**: Students, educators, researchers, and professionals seeking reference materials in advanced computer science and engineering disciplines.

---

## Motivation

Education is not a destination but a continuous journey. This repository represents my commitment to that philosophy: a deliberate effort to preserve, organize, and revisit the advanced knowledge acquired during my graduate studies in Computer Engineering.

The creation of this archive stems from a fundamental belief: **true learning transcends the classroom and extends far beyond graduation**. As I navigate my professional career, I recognize that the advanced concepts, methodologies, and problem-solving frameworks developed during these formative years remain invaluable. However, knowledge, when not actively maintained, fades. This repository serves as my intellectual foundation: a structured collection I can return to for relearning, reference, and reflection.

**Why this repository exists:**

- **Knowledge Preservation**: To capture and maintain the depth of understanding developed across four semesters of rigorous graduate study
- **Continuous Learning**: To create a resource that supports lifelong learning, enabling me to revisit advanced principles as I encounter complex challenges
- **Academic Integrity**: To document my authentic academic journey - every concept studied, every project implemented, every problem solved
- **Open Contribution**: To share these materials with the broader community, believing that knowledge grows when freely exchanged

This is more than a collection of files or a digital archive. It is a testament to years of intellectual growth, a record of challenges overcome, and a foundation upon which future learning will be built. By making this work publicly available, I hope it serves not only my own continued education but also assists others on their learning journeys.

> [!NOTE]
> All materials in this repository were created, compiled, and organized by me throughout my graduate program (2023-2024) as part of my coursework, laboratory assignments, and project implementations.
